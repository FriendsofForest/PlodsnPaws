                        <p class="section-container-spacer">Sam met our two boysterious but anxious dogs a few weeks ago and has really quickly won their trust, which isn't easy. They've been on a few walks together and Sam was a real help when we both fell ill recently, it was such a relief to know the boys could still get out and about! We base our review on how our dogs react and they give a unanimous 5 paw review!

                        <p class="section-container-spacer">Sam is amazing with my two Dogs. They absolutely adore her and love going for their walks, whether that’s individual or group walks. One of my dogs this morning was sat by the front door, I wish it was because I was going to work but no it’s because he knows Sam will be coming soon to take him out and he just can’t wait. Sam has spent a lot of time making sure my anxious, sometimes challenging dogs feel comfortable and happy at all times. Working with me and then to make sure they are getting the most out of their time with her. From sitting in our house for a few hours, to enlisting strangers to help with our grumpy 5 year olds behaviour around new dogs. Or even stopping over for the weekend whilst we were away.  She could not do enough to help me and my dogs, even when the boys have been unwell (which recently is a lot). Sam is always on hand to offer advice and support and I cannot thank her enough for it.  Sam isn’t just our dog walker she is a friend.  She cares just as much about your dog as you do, she cannot do enough for them and even at short notice. Sam even sends you daily pictures and updates of how their day has been, even videos of them on a GoPro. I trust her completely with our fur babies. Such an amazing person, thank you so much Sam xx

                        <p class="section-container-spacer">Sam is a wonderful trainer and has a lovely personality. I warmed to her instantly which is important to me. I need to be comfortable with someone to give them the responsibility to care for my dog as I would care for him and access to my house when I am not there. Sam has proven to be the best trainer we have ever had for our lovely doggy. Marvin my 1yr old lab is extremely fond of Sam and her husband, Marvin is always so excited to see her and adores her beautiful Dalmatian Belle.Sam has been instrumental in getting Marvin to stop pulling on his lead. Sam gave very constructive advice on our first meeting and we agreed to ensure we use the same terms with Marvin so he can better learn what we want from him, we had been using different commands for the same things and he must have been so confused but we didn't know what we were doing wrong. Marvin listens and now understands what we are asking him, I couldn't be more proud of him or more grateful to Sam.I would recommend her to anyone at the end of their wits training their doggy or to anyone simply wanting a caring and qualified trainer to walk their little member of the family whilst they are busy.

                        <p class="section-container-spacer">Sam is doing a brilliant job with our lively little terrier! 1-2-1 lead training is providing us with the skills we require to, hopefully one day soon, be able to go for pleasant calm walks rather than fraught drags!! Thank you Sam for being wonderful with us and with Lula.

                        <p class="section-container-spacer">Sam had been giving us social distancing puppy training. Buddy is extremely happy to see Sam every week without fail, so Buddy definitley gives Sam 5 Stars. As do I, we get a leaflet with everything we've covered that week, with tips on how to continue at home, and Sam is only a message away if we have any questions. Looking forward to Buddy's first test next week to see how he is progressing. 5 stars from both of us.

She has taken time to work on dexters recall with him on his group walks and he is so much better on his walks now and also with other dogs! I wouldn’t trust anyone else with him! She always sends me daily updates of their walks which look amazing! I would highly recommend Sam for any of your doggy needs! She’s the best!

                        <p class="section-container-spacer">We would 100% recommend Sam for any of your doggo’s needs! Finding the right dog walker for our pup was really important to us and as soon as we met Sam we instantly knew she was the one. Not only was she warm & friendly with us she showered our pup with love and affection and they created a lovely bond from the get go. Sam is reliable, professional and treats every doggo like her own. We trust her 100% and we can see how much she loves & cares for our pup (he even has a week-long holiday booked with her over summer whilst we attend a wedding abroad!).We also took up training with Sam - we have completed the first two puppy-class courses, both of which were a real success. We’ve all learnt so much & came away with an abundance of knowledge & tips. Thank you for everything you’ve done & do! X

                        <p class="section-container-spacer">I can’t recommend Sam enough for both dog walking and puppy training classes, she’s amazing! Our 5 month puppy absolutely adores her, she gets so excited to see her when she collects her for walks. Dog walking has been brilliant for socialising Roo, Sam always tries to introduce her to new dogs on every walk. Roo loves meeting all her new friends! I love that Sam always sends lots of pictures and videos after each walk so you can see what they have been up to! Puppy training is great, we have learnt so much even if it is through zoom at the minute, Sam always has great advice to give, even for issues that aren’t so straight forward.It can be hard to trust someone coming into your house whilst you’re out, but I would definitely recommend Lacey’s Plods ‘n’ Paws for any needs you have, she is super reliable as well as trustworthy.

She always goes above and beyond and they both adore her too. I can relax knowing that whenever needed she’s there looking after them. My only worry is that they actually prefer seeing her to me!!

                        <p class="section-container-spacer">I contacted Sam regarding Lunas constant barking when meeting other dogs and sometimes chasing them. Sam decided to take Luna 1-1 training for a few weeks, then introducing her to group walks.The difference is a credit to Sam,Lunas behaviour has vastly improved. We can now let her off the lead knowing she will play happily with other dogs .Sam is a lovely caring person and Luna loves her, she is so excited when she comes to pick her up .I would  recommend Sam to anyone for your pets needs.xx

He was pulling quite bad and it was twising my already damaged back. Samantha  took him on with great effect and over about a month has managed to get Dexter walking along side me and mixing with other dogs as well.Highly recommended.
