                            <b>Dog walking</b><br>
                            - If for some reason you have to cancel a walk, please give us as much notice as possible, however the dead line is 18:00 the previous day. If you fail to let me know by 18:00 the previous day, you will be charged 50% of the service fee (as a dog walker will have already been organised).<br>
                            -  Owner is responsible and will ensure that their dog is up to date with their vaccinations, flea and worm treatments<br>
                            - By law, all dogs must wear a well fitted collar or harness with an ID tag with owner’s contact details on.<br>
                            - By law, all dogs must be microchipped.<br>
                            - In the event of an emergency we recommend owners provide us with a contact number for yourselves and a trusted third party. However, we reserve the right to make decisions regarding your dog’s health  and therefore the owner is responsible for any payment of any veterinary fees incurred by Plods n Paws. (This is the same if you have agreed for your pooch to be off lead. However, I will not let them off if I believe they do not have good recall)<br>
                            - Your booked time is only an estimation and whilst I make every effort to arrive at the time given, road conditions and unforeseen circumstances may delay us, so please allow up to 60 minutes after your booked time slot for me to arrive. <br>
                            - You as the owner are liable for any damage incurred to property or third party, injury or loss of your dog if you agree or request for me to let them off the lead. <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Small pet care</b><br>
                            - If permission is given to myself to let the cats, rabbits or small pets out during the day and/or night during holiday care, you as the owner take full responsibility for any damage incurred to property or third party, injury or loss of your cat.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Grooming</b><br>
                            - I have the right to stop a grooming session if the dog is distressed and/or becoming aggressive.<br>
                            - If an accident should happen during a groom, I have the right to perform basic treatment and/or take them to a vet.<br>
                            - Fleas and ticks need to be kept under control so if a dog is found to have them I hold the right to treat them at extra cost, or refuse to continue the groom.<br>
                            - You as the owner confirm that your dog(s) are fully up to date with vaccinations and fleas/worms.<br>
                            - If a dog has a matted coat, a groom cannot continue until the matts are removed. A cost will be added on for the removal of such.
